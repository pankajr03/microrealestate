## Getting started

Get started with the application by following the installation steps.

> Prerequisite
>
> - [Docker and docker-compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the GitHub repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate.git
```

### 2. Build an Start the application

To effectively build and run the application, make use of the `mre` executable on Linux. If you are using Windows, utilize `mre.exe`, whereas on Mac, opt for `mre-macos`.

```shell
$ cd microrealestate
$ ./mre build
```

When building the first time, you can expect a series of questions to configure the application. Answer the questions as prompted to tailor the application to your specific needs. Once you've completed this interactive configuration, a `.env` file will be generated, containing your settings.

```
? Have you created a mailgun account for sending emails (https://www.mailgun.com/)? No

? Enter the URL to access the landlord front-end: http://localhost:8080/landlord

? Enter the URL to access the tenant front-end (it should share the same domain and port as the landlord front-end URL): http://localhost:8080/tenant
```

Once the build process has been completed, execute the following command to launch the application:

```shell
$ ./mre start
```

Once the application has started successfully, you will find a link displayed in the console to access the application.

Simply copy the link and paste into your preferred web browser to access the application's interface.
